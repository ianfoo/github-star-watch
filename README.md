# github stargazer ðŸ¤©  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ianfoo/github-stargazer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ianfoo/github-stargazer)

All in the hopes of an [unsolicited back
massage](https://twitter.com/matryer/status/1042270822923030528) from [Mat
Ryer](https://github.com/matryer) when
[BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) hits 10,000 stargazers.

### Really though, what is it?

This will watch any GitHub repo for any number of stars, and send an SMS when
the target is reached.

### Is that all it does?

Yes. Right now, anyway.

### Um, ok.

It's cool.

### Really?

Shut up.

## Fine. How do I use it?

First, get it. You'll need [Go](https://golang.org).
```bash
$ go get github.com/ianfoo/github-stargazer/...
```

You need a [Twilio](https://twilio.com) account so that you can send SMS.  A
[trial
account](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223136107-How-does-Twilio-s-Free-Trial-work-)
will work fine. After you have that, set the following environment variables.

| Variable              | Set to                                            |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`  | Your Twilio Account SID                           |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`   | Your secret Twilio auth token                     |
| `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` | Your Twilio phone number that should send the SMS |

Then, run it.
```bash
$ github-stargazer -phone 8005551212 -repo matryer/bitbar -target 9999
```

If you end up getting that unsolicited back massage, though, I'm gonna be
really cross with you.

## Complaints and how this could be much better

### There are no tests!

I know, I know. This isn't production quality code, and I don't actually
recommend you (or I) write code in this fashion. Tests should be developed at
least in step with the base functionality. It promotes writing simpler, more
testable code, especially if you write the tests first. I dove in head first,
and I'm sorry. In having performed a bit of refactoring, I can tell you that
it would have been a little easier to get things back to a working state if
I'd had tests to run. I was going to write tests as part of this refactor,
but it's getting really late and it's only Wednesday. Well, Thursday morning
now.

In any case, maybe this will become more generally useful at some point, and
have thousands of stars, but at this point it was just a diversion and an
excuse to poke around Twilio and GitHub's APIs.  It could be improved in many
ways, some of which I am aware of right now, and others I'm sure I would never
think of.

### What ways can you think of that it could be improved right now?

* Some testing.
* Give error handling some actual thought and improve the slapdash job done
  here.
* Better logging: forcing starwatcher package to use zap.SugaredLogger is too
  specific?
* Separate the orthogonal concerns of GitHub and Twilio interaction.
* Follow-up checking on Twilio message status/delivery.
* Graceful shutdown.
* Other message transports, e.g., FB Messenger, Twitter.
* Support more than just stargazers.

If you have other ideas and are so motivated, file issues and/or PRs!
